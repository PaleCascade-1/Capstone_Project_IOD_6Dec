Repository for Github Capstone Project
This capstone project contains a few files:
1. Deploy.py is the code that contains my file that I used for deploying on streamlit. The link to the streamlit app is here: https://palecascade-1-deployment-deploy-1m8aj4.streamlit.app/
2. Model for Deployment - Insurance.ipynb is the file that I used to generate the XGBoost model as a pkl file, called "insurance_claim_classifier.pkl"
3. Insurance Claim Predictions.pptx is the file I used for my capstone project presentation.
4. train_csv is the csv file that I used to train my model.
5. Capstone Project - Predict Insurance Claims.ipynb is the main file with the coding of EDA, and the various models I used to develop the predictive model.
